  title: "The MK1 - A Simple Tracked Robot",
  description: "My first robot build, using a raspberry pi. I have made a series of blog posts documenting the process to build the robot. While it's not intended as a tutorial, I did try to provide enough detail that anyone could follow along and build their own robot. Currently the robot has no intelligence - instead it's controllable over wifi - but I do intend to make it more autonomous in future. This project was on hold for a couple of years while I completed my Masters degree, but I'll be getting back into it soon, so watch this space!",

  title: "Teaching a Legged Robot to Walk (In Simulation)",
  description: "For my Masters degree in AI, my final project involved using reinforcement learning to teach a simple simulated legged robot to walk. I aimed to teach the robot to walk across a variety of difficult terrain, using three different methods of improving learning. While this is currently only in simulation, I hope to expand on this legged robot controller alongside building a real life version of the robot to use it on.",
